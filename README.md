# N#

N# is a multi-paradigm programming language of my own creation back in 2015. It was built for SmileBASIC on the Nintendo 3DS, and was intended to transpile into SmileBASICv3. It has support for object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, and adds several language features that SmileBASIC lacks.
